## About Me
Hi everyone! I am Dami, a web developer with 2 years of experience. I'm an AI enthusiast, and I recently built a React/Expo app powered by Google Gemini Pro. This project was especially fun because I drew my character and using Nano banana to create an animated character that brings a good web experience for my portfolio.

## How I Built It
I built this project with Google AI tools like Antigravity and Gemini Pro, The character and image stuff was made with Google Nano banana and Veo3. Everything was made by Google AI stuff, Here's how I did:

1. I used Nano banana with Google Gemini Pro to generate the characters, background images and other visual stuff 
2. I refined those assets in [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com) to edit advance stuff like background removal and object isolation
3. To animate the character, I use Google Veo 3 and polished CapCut.
4. Finally, I containerised the app with Docker to deploy it to Google Cloud Run

## What I'm Most Proud Of
I first experimented with a macOS‑style UI for my portfolio, but ultimately redesigned it as a room‑themed interface so I could use drag‑and‑drop interactions with the graphics in the space. The room concept works surprisingly well in practice and makes the whole experience feel more playful and interactive.

Main tech stacks
- Typescript
- Vite/SSR
- GSAP for drag & drop animation
- Notion Client API
- Docker
